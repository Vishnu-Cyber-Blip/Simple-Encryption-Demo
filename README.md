# Simple-Encryption-Demo
This is a website showing a simple new encryption system under the idea of 'Mapping of Hyper-ECC onto ECC for Cryotorgaphy'

**Save all html files under a foler named 'templates'. 

Run the python flask file for the encryption demo. ( ency.html only with python flask application ).

Run index.html to get a glimpse of the working of the project.**
